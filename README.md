A first repository for practice

Hello People! 

My name is Cosette Hampton, I am a recent grad of the College at the University of Chicago ('17) and a current MPP student at Harris. I am originally from the South side of Chicago and I live in the Woodlawn neighborhood. I care about urban community development, specifically anti-poverty policy, fair & affordable housing policy, and equity issues in Black and Brown communities. I hope to have a position as a policy or data analyst one day, where I still have time to do grassroots community organizing work on issues that impact Black people, like mass incarceration, overt policing and underinvestment by the State. I'm working towards becoming a pescatarian and my favorite foods are big seafood broils, quesadillas, brioche french toast, and peach cobbler!
